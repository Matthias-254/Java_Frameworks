# Java-framework project (spring+maven)

This project was created by Matthias Lannoo. I used a database for this project, so if you want to use it, make sure to set up the database with the name "news". For this project, I used exercises from my Java Frameworks class. Additionally, I frequently used the website Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com) to fix small errors.
